# Advent of Code
This repository contains my solutions for the challenges provided on the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website.

## Tasks
This repository contains two tasks which can be executed in VS Code.

- `Initialize Advent of Code for current year`
- `Initialize Puzzle for today` 
- `Initialize Advent of Code`
- `Initialize Puzzle` 

*If you don't use VS Code, you can also call the shell scripts in the root folder to achieve the same. They have command line arguments if you want to create the folders / files for a specific year / day.*
